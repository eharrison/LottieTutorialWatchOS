A wrapper for [rlottie](https://github.com/Samsung/rlottie) + Xcode project.
This enables Carthage && SwiftPM support.

This repo also including the CocoaPods's spec file to use rlottie.

## Requirements

+ iOS 9
+ macOS 10.10
+ tvOS 9.0
+ watchOS 2.0

## Note

The Samsung's rlottie now release the first tag version, see: [rlottie#159](https://github.com/Samsung/rlottie/issues/159). And this repo match the same version tag as upstream.

Previously this repo has same tag like v0.1.0, which use the HASH `a717479`. Now it's removed. Please update your Package Manager by following the steps:

+ CocoaPods: `pod cache clean librlottie` && `pod update`
+ Carthage: `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.carthage.CarthageKit` && `carthage update --cache-builds`
+ SwiftPM: `Xcode Clean`

## For iOS and Simulator

The rlottie source code use [C++ Thread Local](https://cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword/thread_local) feature. However, iOS use system provided ABI for C++ thread local support but not language side, which works only on iOS 9.0+, and does not support 32-bit i386 Simulator.

This is why we have to limit the min deployment target version on iOS. Learn more here: [Why does Apple clang disallow C++11 thread_local when 'official' clang supports it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28094794/why-does-apple-clang-disallow-c11-thread-local-when-official-clang-supports)

## Installation

### Carthage

librlottie is (via this repo) available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

```
github "SDWebImage/librlottie-Xcode"
```

### CocoaPods

librlottie is available through [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods).

```
pod 'librlottie'
```

### SwiftPM

librlottie is available through [Swift Package Manager](https://img.shields.io/badge/SwiftPM-compatible-brightgreen.svg).

```swift
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/SDWebImage/librlottie-Xcode", from: "0.1.0")
    ],
    // ...
)
```

## Usage

Use librlottie as you would normally, this is just a repo that adds an Xcode proj.

For Swift Package Manager user, it's recommended to use the modular import instead of C headers.

+ Objective-C

```objective-c
@import librlottie;
// or if you don't use module
#import <rlottie/rlottie_capi.h>
```

+ Swift

```swift
import librlottie
```

## For C++ user

The rlottie umbrella header and modulemap does not contains C++ header `rlottie.h`, because Swift/Objective-C can not import C++ interface (Objective-C++ can, but with clang module disabled).

If you need the C++ interface, use the public header search path to `include`, make sure you have disable module as well.
